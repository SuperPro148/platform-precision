## Platform Precision

A simple mod designed to make building platforms quicker and easier.

Adds a keybind to position yourself perfectly to build platforms quickly and safely without having to sneak.
And it's *not* safewalk!

Just build a single row of blocks (or top slabs!) and stand at one of the ends, then press F7 (or whatever key you configured it to) to position yourself.
Now you can safely strafe sideways to the other end while holding down your block placing button.
When you're done you can just press F7 again and build the next row.
It will not move you if you're above an air block, to prevent falling off the platform.

Every part of the mod is configurable, so there's most likely a lot more uses for it.
The tutorial above is intended for the default settings.

Requires YetAnotherConfigLib, Mod Menu and ConfigLib148 for configuration.
